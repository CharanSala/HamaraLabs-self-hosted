You will apply your understanding of frictional forces to create a sled that minimizes friction and maximizes travel distance.",

The sled's design should allow for the easy attachment and detachment of different materials to its underside (the part that will be in contact with the testing surface).",
      "2. **Hypothesize:** Choose several different materials (e.g., fabric, plastic wrap, sandpaper, aluminum foil) and hypothesize which material will allow the sled to travel the farthest on your chosen surface (e.g., carpet, tile, wood floor). Explain your reasoning based on your understanding of friction.",
      "3. **Experiment:** Set up a designated testing area and mark a starting line.  For each material, conduct multiple trials where you release the sled from the starting line and measure the distance it travels before coming to a stop. Ensure consistency in the sled's release mechanism to maintain fairness in the experiment.",

Challenge students to design and construct a simple parachute that will slow the descent of a small weight (e.g., a toy figure, a bunch of paperclips).  Encourage creativity in their initial designs.",
      "2. **Materials:** Provide a variety of materials for parachute construction, including lightweight fabrics, plastic bags, string, tape, and paperclips (or other small weights).",
      "3. **Testing & Observation:**  Find a safe location with some height (e.g., a staircase, a balcony) to conduct the parachute drops.  Have students drop their parachutes with the attached weights and observe their descent.  Encourage them to pay attention to the speed of the descent and how stable the parachute is during its fall.",
      "4. **Modification & Improvement:** After initial testing, guide students to modify their parachute designs to improve their performance.  This might involve changing the size or shape of the canopy, adjusting the length of the strings, or adding vents or other features. Encourage them to test different variations and record their observations.",
      "5. **Analysis & Conclusion:** As they experiment, encourage students to analyze their findings.  How did different modifications affect the parachute's descent? What factors seemed to have the most significant impact on slowing down the weight?  Relate their observations to the concept of air resistance and discuss how parachutes are used in real-world applications."
